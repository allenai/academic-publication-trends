# Academic Publication Trends 

How can we quantify the pace of academic publication? 
To achieve a quantitative approach to measuring the pace of scientific publications, we use the publication statistics of the arXiv platform.
We did this analysis in the context of recent events (e.g., COVID-19) and write [an article](https://medium.com/ai2-blog/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-scientific-productivity-73bea003f4e9) about our findings.   


## Data 
The data used in the study is available in the `data` directory. 
It consists of more than 1 million paper submissions on this platform, covering all the submissions made to this platform from 2011 to May 2020. 
Each submission data comes with a scientific area label, date of submission and the location (country) from which the submissions are made. 
The name of the paper/authors are deleted for privacy protection.     

**Acknowledgment**: we thank arXiv for making their data available for this analysis.
